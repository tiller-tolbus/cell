# Milestone 2

[Grant at urbit.org](https://urbit.org/grants/membrane)

Expected Completion: May 2023

Payment: 3 stars

## Current TODOs

- [ ] `[frontend / backend]` I can organize my spreadsheets into folders that are visible from my homepage.
- [ ] `[frontend / backend]` I can view an edit history of the sheet I'm working on and revert back to an arbitrary date.
- [ ] `[frontend / backend?]` I can use any formula from the [Formula.JS](https://formulajs.info/) library to reference other cells within my sheet, and have those formulas automatically update when their referenced cells change.
- [ ] `[frontend]` I can select a group of consecutive cells and copy-paste them into another group of consecutive cells.
- [ ] `[frontend]` I can search my spreadsheet, or a selection within my spreadsheet, for a pattern of characters, and perform find/replace within my search.
- [ ] `[frontend]` I can select a group of cells matching a pattern such as `A1 = 1, A2 = 2, A3 = 3...` and drag so that the following cells follow the pattern, ex. `A4 = 4, A5 = 5...`.
- [ ] `[frontend / backend]` I can export my spreadsheets to CSV format and download them onto my Terran computer.
- [ ] `[frontend / backend]` I can import CSV spreadsheets from my Terran computer onto Membrane.
- [ ] `[backend]` `[may be better to just accept all changes automatically (maybe with some max size?) and have root folders corresponding to source ship for each file/directory...]` When receiving a spreadsheet over the network that conflicts with the path of an existing spreadsheet, I can view the changes made to my local copy and decide which changes, if any, to overwrite my local copy with.
- [ ] `[wordcel]` I can read about the features of `Membrane` by looking at its page in the `Documentation` app.
- [ ] `[backend]` My spreadsheets expose an API that can be accessed by third-party front-ends, as well as other Urbit apps. All pokes and scries are documented in the `Documentation` app. This API contains, at minimum, the following operations:
  - [x] `[backend]` Create an empty spreadsheet
  - [x] `[backend]` Delete a spreadsheet
  - [x] `[backend]` Rename a spreadsheet
  - [ ] `[backend]` Change the location of a spreadsheet in the Clay filesystem
  - [x] `[backend]` Add or remove tags to a spreadsheet
  - [x] `[backend]` `[obsolete]` Change the access level of a user in a spreadsheet
  - [ ] `[backend]` Retrieve an entire spreadsheet in JSON
  - [ ] `[backend]` Replace an entire spreadsheet with a new spreadsheet from JSON
  - [ ] `[backend]` Retrieve a list of subfolders or spreadsheets within a given directory
  - [ ] `[backend]` Modify the value and/or metadata of a cell
  - [ ] `[backend]` Retrieve the value and metadata of a cell in JSON
  - [ ] `[backend]` Retrieve an entire row of cells in JSON
  - [ ] `[backend]` Retrieve an entire column of cells in JSON
  - [ ] `[backend]` Batch a series of changes to be entered sequentially

## Bonus
- [ ] `[backend]` Write a `+grad` arm for the `sheets` mark to make storage more efficient in clay.
